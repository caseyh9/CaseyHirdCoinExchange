      <h1>Questionnaire</h1>

      <h3>1. Are there any sub-optimal choices (or short cuts taken due to limited time) in your implementation?</h3>
      <p>The primary sub-optimal choice is that at http request is sent from the backend to each exchange every time
         a request is sent from the frontend. There is also a little of bit of hardcoding (for terms like "buy" and "sell")
          which in a larger, optimized project would be more systematically abstracted to a properties/localization file.
         There is also the issue that each http request must be formatted separately, even though we have a list of exchanges.
        This is unavoidable though, since obviously we can't choose what format each exchange api will accept. Finally, the frontend
       could certainly benefit from more styling, particularly styling that makes it clear which exchange has the best price.</p>

      <h3>2. Is any part of it over-designed? (It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)</h3>
      <p>The most obviously over-designed aspect is the way this app is built to allow for new exchanges and new coins to be added easily,
       with nothing more than a few additions to seed data and handling of http request formatting. The app is also designed to allow for
        simple additions that would expand the app to handle other market data for the given coins.</p>

      <h3>3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?</h3>
      <p>The primary issue in scaling would be the frequency of http requests. Obviously if the app is accepting 100 requests every
       second, it cannot itself be making 100 requests to each exchange every second. This could be improved simply by making http
      requests to the list of exchanges at a set interval, say every 5 seconds, rather than sending them on request. The optimal
       solution though, would be to use web-sockets to get real-time info. This would also allow the functionality of the app to
        expand, as I'll discuss in the next section.</p>

      <h3>4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation</h3>
      <p>This app could be greatly enhanced by using web-sockets to establish persistent connections to the exchanges. This would
       lead to a lot more incoming data, but with that a lot more potential. The app could then store historical data, and go beyond
      just diplaying recommendations to actually train different models. Also, with real-time info, the app could easily be modified
     to alert users when an arbitrage opportunity arises between exchanges, or even to execute such trades itself.</p>
